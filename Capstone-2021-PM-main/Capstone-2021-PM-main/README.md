## Architecture

#### N-Tier Design
>The Back-On-Track software system utilizes an N-Tier Design with two different presentation layers, one being a WPF Desktop Presentation Layer and the other being an MVC Web Layer. 
#### SQL Server Data Layer
>Stored procedures are implemented to allow for control of the flow of data and provide a layer of security around data in efforts to sanitize information flowing from the user. The DBMS is designed to work fluidly within the ASP.NET architecture, effectively managing the connection to the IT system.
#### WPF Desktop Presentation Layer
>WPF is used to render views to the business side of application, utilizing XAML and C# to facilitate UI interactions while providing a customized experience based on whichever department the user belongs to. The MVC pattern is implemented to allow for similar modularity and flow that is seen in the MVC Web Layer.
#### MVC Web Layer
>The user-interface, data, and logic layers are decoupled through the Model-View-Controller pattern, again reinforcing separation of concerns. ASP.NET allows for validation rules to be applied within the models themselves, providing comprehensive coverage of outlined business requirements. The controllers receive routed requests which are implemented via C#. Furthermore, Razor syntax reinforces HTML5 compliancy throughout the web pages served by Back-On-Track's server while also employing the full force of the C# programming language.
